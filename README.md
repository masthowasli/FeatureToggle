# FeatureToggle

The FeatureToggle component laverages the easy to configure and easy to integrate
use of features (i.e. software/project parts) in a php 5.3+ application.

The sole purpose is to easily configure through configuration file or DI
Container/Service Locator enabled/disabled features of an application. The
control of features in the view layer is also managed through extensions for
different templating engines.
